what are the two basic function of the electron transport chain	An electron transport chain (ETC) is a series of compounds that transfer electrons from electron donors to electron acceptors via redox reactions, and couples this electron transfer with the transfer of protons (H + ions) across a membrane.n the mitochondrial electron transport chain electrons move from an electron donor (NADH or QH 2) to a terminal electron acceptor (O 2) via a series of redox reactions.	Electron carriers are reduced during glycolysis and the citric acid cycle to NADH + H+ and FADH2. These carriers then donate electrons and protons to the electron carrier proteins of the electron transport chain. The final electron acceptor is oxygen.Together with oxygen, electrons and protons form molecules of water.our protein complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane form the electron transport chain. These complexes exist in a descending order of energy. Here the electron carriers come along to drop off all their electron and proton cargo that they picked up during the glycolysis and citric acid cycle stages.

what are nuclear plants for	How Nuclear Plants Generate Electricity. Nuclear plants, like plants that burn coal, oil and natural gas, produce electricity by boiling water into steam. This steam then turns turbines to produce electricity. The difference is that nuclear plants do not burn anything. Instead, they use uranium fuel, consisting of solid ceramic pellets, to produce electricity through a process called fission. Nuclear power plants obtain the heat needed to produce steam through a physical process. This process, called fission, entails the splitting of atoms of uranium in a nuclear reactor. The uranium fuel consists of small, hard ceramic pellets that are packaged into long, vertical tubes. Bundles of this fuel are inserted into the reactor.	Noun. 1.

what is the number of neutrons in iodine	Iodine Half-Life Experiment. Iodine is element number 53. That is, Iodine has 53 protrons and 53 electrons. That is what determines that it is Iodine. We could also say that for Iodine, Z = 53. How many neutrons does Iodine have? Most naturally-occuring Iodine is Iodine-127. We could say A = 127. Remember, A is the atomic mass number of an isotope -- the total number of nucleons inside the nucleus. A is the total number of the protons and neutrons inside the nucleus, A = Z + N. N = A - Z. N = 127 - 53. N = 74. Most naturally-occuring Iodine has 74 neutrons. We can write this as. 127 I 53. What happens if this naturally-occuring Iodine-127 absorbs a neutron?	Answer: Sodium, Na, has atomic number 11. This means sodium atoms have 11 protons in the nucleus. The atom has a mass number equal to the number of protons and neutrons, so there must be 12 neutrons in the nucleus.
